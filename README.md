# csgo-cfg
My config files for CS:GO

All custom files can be found in the /custom/ folder, with the exception of
autoexec.cfg, which must be located where it is.  Everything else is pretty
unremarkable.

All settings are for 1366x728 resolution.  You should only need to change the
crosshair settings and the /custom/fix_all.cfg resolutions.

As much as possible, everything has been centralized.  Most (all?) aliases
should be located in autoexec.cfg.  I have prefixed aliases with 'mor7' where
I felt it was relevant.

This will be updated from time to time as I make changes and add things.  If
you'd like to see something added or whatever, shoot me a message.  If you do
something interesting you want to share, send me a pull request.


Have fun and play hard,
-mor7
